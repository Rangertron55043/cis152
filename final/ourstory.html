            <h3>Where to find us?</h3>
            <p>
              Pacific Trail Resorts is located within northern California almost crossing the state of Oregon to the west reaching the Pacific Ocean. The Mediterranean-forest climate predominates in the diverse area in the flora and fauna of the region. You'll find big, tall trees that are over a thousand years old like the sequoias in Sequoia National Park in Tulare County. The fauna has thousands of unique and striking plants in the northwest region of the country while in the fauna you will find a variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and exotic insects that you find in the region.

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>
              We are workers of the region, we take care of the environment of the region and the biodiversity of the flora and fauna both in ecosystem research and for 50 years. We guide tourists in visiting the region and teach them how the region's ecosystem works. We also teach you what the species of fauna are and their function in the ecosystem. We also have recreational places that can have contact with nature and enjoy the landscapes of the place, explore the forests, swim in the lakes, watch the sunset on the beach for a morning and sunset.
